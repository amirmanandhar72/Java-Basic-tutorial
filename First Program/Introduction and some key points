Intro to JDK JRE and JVM

JDK-> Java Development Kit
We get the libraries which we will use while programming java.

JRE-> Java Runtime Environment.
It is a environment where we can write the java code, execute .Its a platform.

JVM -> Java Virtual Machine
It checks the errors on the program. 


For floating value->

float a= 3.45f ->f is needed 


Abstract Class:
It’s a abstract class in which abstract methods are defined . This class gets inherited to its child classes and can override the methods.
For eg We have two classes .

1st class 
Public abstract class Student {
	Public abstract void name();
	Public abstract void age();
}

Now a normal class
Overrides the function
Public class student1 extends Student{
	Public void name(){
	System.out.println(“My name is Amir”);
}

Public class student2{
	Public void name(){
	System.out.println(“My name is Ajay”);
}
Simply make the object of student 1 and 2 and use it..


Interface:
Its same as the abstract class.Its just a template for any classes to use the function.

Access Specifiers:
Public: If any variable ,classes are public then all other classes can access the variable .No any restriction..
Private: if any of the class is private or variables are private , then it cant be access by any of the classes.
Protected: only inherited child and the class of same package can access the protected classes.
